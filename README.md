# Traincraft - A mod for Minecraft

Here you will find the source code for the **Official Traincraft Project**.

This repository is only for release versions. Pull requests should be sent to the repository at https://github.com/EternalBlueFlame/Traincraft-5.


## What is Traincraft?

Traincraft is a mod written for [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/). It is built on top of the [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge) API.

It adds new functionality and looks to the vanilla trains, and some other areas of the game. It adds over 80+ trains, wagons, and other vehicles. It also ads a completely new railway system with curved tracks and slopes. It was originaly started by **Spitfire4466**, then jointly developed with **Mrbrutal**, and now maintained by me, **Mrbrutal**. It has had well over 1,000,000 downloads and has been in development since 1.2.x versions of Minecraft.

## Why are you posting the Source Code?

> Since Spitfire4466 and me are exceedingly low on time to work on this project, open source was the only viable sollution. But since open source is something I've never done on this level or size, I'm a bit hessitant to do so. But in the hopes that I can still be a part of this and so that we can make Traincraft great again, I'm opening the source code for everyone to see. Furthermore, both versions of Traincraft will be open sourced, so that anyone willing to contribute will be able to contribute on both fronts.

## Issues

## Contributing

Traincraft Project welcomes contributions from anyone, provided they have signed the Contributor Licensing Agreement (CLA) found [here](https://cla-assistant.io/Mrbrutal/Traincraft).

Signing the CLA is simple, just follow the link, and hit the "I Agree" button and you are good to go.

Regarding new features/behavior changes, please submit a Suggestion Issue to the Tracker before you write a single line of code. Keeping everyone on the same page saves time and effort and reduces negative experiences all around when a change turns out to be controversial.

For now, the focus should be on updating the mod to the 1.7.x and 1.11.x (master) branches, before adding any new features. Those will be added when the rewrite version is being done.

## Building

Traincraft will follow standard Forge conventions for setting up and building a project, with a couple additional details (details to come).

There will also be a jenkins build engine available for setting things up, and building releases quicker (details to come).
